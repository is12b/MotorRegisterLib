MotorRegisterLib
================

A small library for a school project. 

The IDEA is:
  - Scraping data from https://motorregister.skat.dk based on licence plate number, and generating a car there by.
  - Scraping data from http://selvbetjening.trafikstyrelsen.dk/ again based on the licence plate number, and getting the inspections and reports for said car.

TODO:
- Better error handling
- Comments
- Headers
- Version
- Release!
